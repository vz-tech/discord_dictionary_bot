The intended purpose of this bot is to retrieve both the "reading" and "definition" of a single word entered after the function "!Jisho ", whether in English or Japanese characters, through Discord.

To install this bot, install node.js and npm. 
Then, create a folder called "tokens", and then inside the folder, create a file called "auth.json {"token" : "yourbotTokenCodehere"}.
Then, in the terminal, type npm install and hit enter.
The bot must be invited into your server to be utilized.

To activate the bot on visual studio code under the terminal, type "node bot.js":

To utilize the bot in the server, type "!Jisho " and then a word or character, either in English or Japanese (the Japanese word can be in either hiragana, katakana or kanji) and hit enter. Please note that while the bot can retrieve a Japanese word for a word typed in English, it may not necessarily retrieve the correct one as it responds immediately to the first result searched through Jisho.
